<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm Katrina Voll-Taylor. I'm attending Clark to obtain a degree in Web Development. I have two sons, twins, who just turned 20 years old last month. I have two dogs: one is a black and tan smooth-haired dachshund named Ralph, and the other is a "dorkie," part dachshund/part Yorkie, named Harvey. I have a collection of vintage perfumes, some dating to almost 100 years old.</p>

<h1>Why I'm Taking This Class</h1>
<p>My intention in taking this class is to obtain a good working knowlege of how to use JavaScript to better make web pages I create really sing. I was very impressed by the implementation of it by other students in my PHP class on their final projects last term. They did some really neat things using JavaScript, and I would love to be able to do the same.</p>

<h1>Programming experience</h1>
<p>I have only taken a couple of terms of coding at Clark thus far, so I think its fair to describe my programming skill as still in the beginner stages.<br><br>I have taken the following classes to learn the following languages:</p><ul><li>Python</li><li>PHP</li></ul><p>I have enjoyed PHP the most overall, I think largely in part because we were able to implement it in more practical applications. That said, using Python's visual libraries was a hoot, and it felt deeply gratifying to see our creations put up on the glass.</p>
